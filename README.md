# RetailSync: Manual Shelf Inventory Management

## Project Overview
RetailSync is an inventory management solution designed to help retailers track and manage shelf inventory for electronics departments. While currently a manual system, it is designed with scalability in mind, allowing future integration of hardware sensors or image processing to enhance automation.

## Problem Statement
Retailers frequently encounter inventory challenges, particularly in electronics departments such as the TV section:
- Inaccurate physical vs. digital inventory counts  
- Inefficient stock management  
- Difficulty tracking available shelf spaces  
- Challenges in stock rotation and product placement  

## Key Features
- Manual UPC-based tracking system  
- Location-specific inventory logging  
- Shelf space availability tracking  
- User-driven inventory updates  
- AppSheet mobile interface for ease of use  
- Google Sheets backend for reliable data storage  
- Scalability for future hardware or AI integration  

## Update Mechanism
- Manual data entry by store associates  
- Periodic inventory updates to maintain accuracy  
- User-driven tracking and verification  
- Currently not a real-time synchronization system  

## Technical Approach
- **Platform**: AppSheet  
- **Database**: Google Sheets  
- **Tracking Method**: Manual UPC and Location-based Entry  
- **Future Scalability**: Ready for IoT sensors, image processing, and machine learning integration  

## Project Objectives
1. Reduce inventory discrepancies  
2. Improve shelf management accuracy  
3. Provide clear and actionable inventory visibility  
4. Streamline manual tracking processes  
5. Enable potential automation for real-time updates  

## Development Insights
- Challenges in No-Code Development  
- Performance Optimization Strategies  
- User Feedback Integration for continuous improvement  

## Installation and Setup
### Prerequisites
- Google Workspace Account  
- AppSheet Access  
- Prepared Inventory Spreadsheet Template  

### Setup Steps
1. Clone the repository.  
2. Configure the Google Sheets template.  
3. Set up the AppSheet application using the template.  
4. Train staff on manual update procedures and best practices.  

## User Workflow
1. Physically check shelf locations for stock and availability.  
2. Verify product placements to ensure accuracy.  
3. Update inventory manually via the AppSheet interface.  
4. Reconcile differences between the physical and digital tracking systems.  

## Future Development Possibilities
- **Hardware Integration**: Incorporate IoT sensors for automatic stock tracking.  
- **Image Processing**: Use computer vision to detect stock shortages or placement errors.  
- **Machine Learning**: Predict sales trends and optimize stock replenishment schedules.  

## Limitations
- Depends heavily on accurate human input for now.  
- Not a real-time synchronization solution at this stage.  
- Requires consistent user engagement to maintain system accuracy.
